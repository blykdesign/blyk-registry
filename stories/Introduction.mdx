# blyk design system

blyk is a design system built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), providing accessible, customizable, and composable components distributed via a custom registry.

## Principles

- **Open Code** — All component source code is open for customization. You own the code.
- **Composition** — A common, composable interface shared across all components.
- **Distribution** — JSON registry + CLI for installing components into any project.
- **Tokens** — CSS variable-based design tokens for consistent theming.

## Installation

Install components directly from the registry using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://registry.blyk.design/r/base/button.json"
```

You can also install multiple components at once:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://registry.blyk.design/r/base/card.json" \
  "https://registry.blyk.design/r/base/input.json" \
  "https://registry.blyk.design/r/base/label.json"
```

## Theming

blyk uses CSS variables for theming. The base theme ships with light and dark mode support out of the box.

Custom themes can be applied by overriding the CSS variables. See the **Tokens** page for a complete reference of all available variables.
